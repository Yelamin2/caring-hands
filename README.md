# caring-hands
https://caringhands.herokuapp.com/home/
This is my final project at Carolina Code School. I created an app where customers looking for an in-home care provider can connect with available providers. They can message their selected provider, select their desired days of the week and time of the day for services . Providers and generate their service invoices and send them by email to customers.
I used for backend Django, Django RestFramework, for emails used SendGrid API, front end used React, Reactbootstrap.
